# Thought 1: Why do we buy IT?
[Home](/)

Hi – welcome to "30 IT Thoughts in 30 Days", a slow look at how SME owners like us buy and use IT within our businesses.

In business, we rush at things that need to be fixed — there is always today's most urgent problem that needs to be handled. Some pain or other that encourages us to work "in the business", not "on the business". This programme is delivered as a quick email each day – it should take two minutes to read, and ten minutes to think about. By the end of the programme you'll have a solid understanding of the top issues that affect SME owners, and be able to take considered, effective action without rushing, and without hitting unnecessary IT-related "pain points" as you go forward with your business.

We're going to start with a simple question: "Why do we buy IT?"

We all do it – every modern business requires some form of IT, and over time we expend a huge amount, starting with the capital expenditure, associated running costs (subscription costs, electricity, bandwidth), and can run into huge costs associated with risk and misuse. Most people this without really thinking why they do it.

At a very basic level, we buy IT because it's a minimum requirement of doing business. We need email to communicate with customers, suppliers, and partners. We need a web browser to research and access cloud services, and we need a broadband connection to link into a network. But we can do all that very cheaply – just a basic "it's the cost of entry" doesn't explain why IT is such a lucrative business sector.

At the next level, we buy IT in order to control risk. We might buy antivirus to limit the chances of our computers getting infected by viruses or malware. Or we might buy backup solutions to better recover from catastrophic failure like fire, theft, or malicious damage. A great deal of enterprise IT spend (usually a little overkill for SMEs) goes into specialist security products to keep hackers out of systems as well as stopping users from accidentally or deliberately damaging data.

This is normally where SMEs stop – we buy the basics to pay the "cost of entry", and then invest in some backup solutions. This is where larger businesses generally get to as well – they have a set of basics that everyone has, then spent on security and risk management solutions. It's what we can do with IT over and above this that makes things interesting – and that means making some investment in innovation. 

As an SME, thinking creatively about what you can do with your IT is what can get you a competitive edge – and as of the time of writing using IT to "box clever" is exactly what we're doing. Innovation by definition means you are doing something your competitors are not, and IT is nothing more than a box of tools and/or a bag of tricks that helps you innovate. What this really means is bringing software into the business that can let us do something that other people can't do (yet, or hopefully ever).

And that's exactly the focus of what we're going to look at over these coming 30 (now 29) days – what can we do with our IT that makes our businesses more agile, more resilient, and – as someone who runs a social enterprise I have to say this – kinder and more in-tune with the people and communities that we trade in. (And, importantly, how can we do that without handing over huge swathes of cash to IT companies.)

Take care,
Matthew
