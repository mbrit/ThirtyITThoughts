# Thought #26: Remote working
[Home](/)

Hi,

In thought 26 of "30 IT Thoughts", we're going to have a look at something that at the time of writing is highly topical: remote working.

As I mentioned in an earlier instalment, I've tried carefully in this programme to avoid talking about current events – this being for a combination of reasons at least including a) I don't want to age this content, and b) no one really has a clue as to what will happen over the next few years anyway. However, the whole topic of "what now?" is something we have to think about, and we might as well unpack the remote working issue.

In 1984, an American writer called Stewart Brand coined the phrase "information wants to be free". In context, he was talking about how all people should be able to access information freely – today we can look how this idea translates into things like freedom of information requests, and privacy legislation like GDPR. (You can see how ahead of his time he was.) Brand also spoke about tension in that information is also expensive, because it is so valuable, and in particular went on to say "the right information in the right place just changes your life". It's that principle – getting the right information in the right place – that is at the crux of remote working, or rather "mobility".

Mobility as a concept has been around for as long as the IT industry has, and we've had usable products in this space since the 1980s/1990s. (You may remember devices like the Psion Organiser or Palm Pilot) These devices tended to work by having people take a copy of data from a larger, non-mobile computer system, do some work in a mobile fashion, and then copy the data back onto the original system. This is the first example of information wanting to be free – we want to take it with us. However, this approach was itching for a world in which we had broadband-speed internet everywhere – it wasn't sufficient to take small chunks of data with it, we needed to be able to dial into our master set of data wherever we were. 

This is the point in time where the iPhone came along. The introduction of the iPhone, together with good enough mobile internet created a tipping point where mobility went from being something that early adopter geeks did into something that everybody did. This inflexion point also tied into a migration of computer systems into cloud-based approaches as well. By way of an example, BlackBerry was huge at the time that the iPhone was released, and its "killer app" was mobile email. At the time, everyone ran emails on their own servers – cloud email like Microsoft 365 and G Suite was around, but very unusual – and so in order for all these companies to "wire up" BlackBerry phones for their staff, the companies had to do an immense amount of technical jiggery-pokery. Businesses knew that proving access to emails on their private network was a faff, but putting the email in the cloud reduced faff, and so they moved the email into the cloud.

All of this behaviour is driven by information wanting to be free. (Although, information isn't self-aware, so what we're really saying is that people's need for information to be accessible wherever we are and whatever we're doing slowly and inexorably nudges us towards technology that support the "information wants to be free" maxim.)

Tying this back to remote working, we now have an issue. Prior to the Covid-19 epidemic and the ensuing lockdown, information was free, but we as workers were not. By putting all out data in the cloud, by having mobile devices that were both inexpensive and worked well, and by having ever increasing bandwidth "in the ether", we'd created this sort of "free utopia" from the data's perspective, whilst requiring anyone who wanted to work with that data to spend two hours a day in the car commuting. What was the point (what is the point?) of having to physically travel somewhere to access data that is available from virtually every square inch of the planet.

With the lockdowns, the UK government basically made it illegal to do anything other than work remotely, and it turns out that because we had done all this work to make information free, decamping everyone from offices and having them work from home became an absurdly easy task. The data was already where it needed to be – what happened was that business owners realised that if they wanted to keep earning money, they had to change tack from insisting the staff came to an office to access data to one where they could access that data from their living rooms.

"Remote working" itself as a phrase needs unpacking, because what is the "remote" in "remote working". For a knowledge worker-centric organisation – i.e. one that doesn't have plant and machinery – an office has been a social construct anyway. We've moved all the data out to the cloud – we're really only going there to meet with and work with other people. Is there a way that we can think about "remote working" in a way where there isn't a central location? What happens to the business if the workers are as free as the information is?


Take care,
Matt
