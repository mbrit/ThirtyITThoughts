# Thought #22: Big Business
[Home](/)

Hi,

In thought 22 of “30 IT Thoughts”, we’re going to look at the notional differences between big businesses and small businesses, and the differences in their approach to IT and IT strategy.

Notionally, a one-person business and a FTSE 100 business both have to solve the same set of problems. Both types of businesses to develop products, market, sell, and support products – and both types of businesses need to manage their finances and adhere to any regulatory oversight that applies to them. In addition, both types of businesses are just applied application of human endeavour. The only thing that is different between them is the scale of one operating at a small scale, and the other at a large scale.

It follows that if small businesses and large businesses are the same beasts, and that just one has gone through a process of inflation that the other hasn’t (yet), it can be said that there are no differences in how each operates – the differences are broadly limited to cultural and procedural differences. Yes, a larger business might have the scope to have an in-house HR team whereas a small business might outsource that same function, but there isn’t anything *fundamentally* different between how both types of business approach the same problem. What you’re looking at is increased capability that comes from increased maturity. 

It also follows that small business IT and large business IT should look very similar. However, it is often the case that SMEs approach IT in a wildly different way to how large businesses do. (This was a big motivation in me developing this programme, btw.) There are no “goodies” that a large business has that small businesses cannot have when it comes to IT.

In order of largest proportion of IT budget to smallest, large businesses spend on the following: laptops/desktops and smartphones (devices), storage and backup, servers, security, collaboration and communication, and networking. You’ll notice that small businesses spend on these too, and we’re spoken about most of these in this programme. 

Large businesses spend a good amount of money on IT strategy in trying to guess where IT trends are heading. We SMEs need to keep an eye on that, but we don’t necessarily need to think about it too much as, frankly, some of these ideas are crazy. By way of an example, Gartner publishes things called “Hype Cycles” which tells you what these “bleeding edge” ideas are. The 2019 edition Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies includes things like “nanoscale 3D printing”, “synthetic data”, and “AI augmentation” – it’s meaningless for SMEs. It’s also meaningless for larger business too – these sorts of really bleeding edge, crazy technologies that people talk about are highly specialised, niche activities undertaken by highly specialised, niche businesses. 

However, as a small business grows to become a medium business and then a large business, we have to start adopting behaviour that is commonplace in the next “tier” of business, regardless of what that behaviour pertains to. We can’t manage HR with 100 people in the same way we do for five people. We can’t manage our accounts at £30m/year in the same way we do at £500k/year. The same is true with IT – it’s most likely going to help us to spend on and manage our IT as if we were a larger business. If we put in the groundwork now, it’ll work out later. 

Looking again at the spend by large businesses, the spending they do (i.e. the investment both in terms of money and application of intelligent thought) as it applies to SMEs comes down to spending on storage, backups and security. Storage is important because all businesses create data as they trade, and this data has to be put somewhere. Backups and security are important for reasons that we’ve already gone though. What can we do to behave like a big business in this regard? It’s simple – we need to have systems, policies and procedures in place for these aspects. Files should only be stored in places in accordance with policy so that they can be found, systems need to be in place to check the health of backups, and culture needs to be changed to understand and support security within the business.

Of course, once we’ve got all that in place, we can turn out minds to using IT to innovate and build efficiency.

Take care,
Matt
