# Thought #28: The Office of 2023
[Home](/)

Hi,

As we approach the end of "30 IT Thoughts" with thought 28, it's worth dipping our toe into what our workplaces and businesses might look like in 2022. Technology columnists opine on this sort of "office of the future" all the time, but of course in the current situation we're risking a look of what a post-Covid-19/post-lockdown world might look like.

Regardless of your personal view of staff working from home, the common view has been – pretty much since Victorian times – that the best place for a worker has been in the office. Over recent years, it's been common that staff ask for more flexibility, and more ability to work from home. The pushback on this has been that business owners have had no way of knowing whether the net result of more people working from home is a drop in productivity with no such drop in expenses – or to put it another way, it's been assumed that working from home has a negative effect on the bottom line.

What's happened this year in 2020 however is that that cat is out of the bag – that when the accounting is done it'll likely be that if there was a reduction in productivity, there was as least likely a related reduction in expenses, and perhaps even a reduction in expenses such that it might make sense to keep people working from home. I would imagine though that in order to make this equation balance, we'd have to consider difficult-to-quantify soft advantages, e.g. increased retention. Regardless, it's going to be very difficult to business owners to push back against an employee who is asserting that they can be as productive working from home.

There are no doubt problems with having a distributed workforce – the one that I can't square is this issue about without a central place to gather and relate organically, how do you replace the "learning by osmosis" part of working in a team physically located together.

So then we have two ends of a continuum – it'll either stay where it is in lockdown, it'll swing back to where it was before lockdown, or it'll find a grey area in the middle. My bet is that it'll stay in the grey.

One huge surprise has been that a shift to remote working was so easy. Like all technology, that technology won't go away, so businesses will always retain a technical ability to support remote work. All our data will stay in the cloud, and the quality of the bandwidth that we have at home will continue to increase in step with or ahead of our bandwidth requirements. 

What about office space? If there isn't a wholesale return to the pre-lockdown use of office space, it stands to reason that there will be a change in how office space is used. At the moment, the received wisdom is that you need one desk per employee. If you have peripatetic workers ("travelling from place to place"), you might use hotdesking. If the "grey" area of post-lockdown means that everyone is peripatetic, what happens to the space? Hotdesking for everyone seems unimaginative – what could we do with the space that we have to foster different ways of working? 

Of course, if you're in the business of providing office space – how do you deal with a reduction in revenue that is bound to happen? And I wonder if there is a huge opportunity in disrupting the "virtual office" market – those who provide mailing addresses and answering services. This market has been a little overpriced for some time, and now we're likely to see a greater demand for such things.

Prior to lockdown, my default position was that if a meeting was to be done, it had to be done in person. (In a previous business about 15 years ago, I would think nothing of travelling three hours for a sales meeting…) It turns out now that we all not only like Zoom (other video conferencing platforms are available, but Zoom's stock price has gone from $76 in February to $244 in June), but that Zoom also works really well. We don't need to jump in the train or a car for a good number of meetings. The effect on travel budgets, on people's time, and even the net benefit in reduction in carbon just by realising the video conferencing actually works is huge.

For me, there are lots of obvious wins in the grey area of a post-lockdown working model. There are cost benefits to the business in a model whereby attendance to the office is optional rather than mandatory, enough to make workers demands for this way of working to make sense. The question to me is what to do about this "learning by osmosis" thing, and what can IT do to support it. 

Take care,
Matt
