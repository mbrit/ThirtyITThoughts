# Thought #6: Coca-Cola and Pepsi
[Home](/)

Hi – and welcome to thought 6 of "30 IT Thoughts".	

Yesterday we thought about the IT market and how a) it's much less complex than it looks, and b) you can mostly win the game by doing what other people do. A corollary to that there is a common way that markets get set-up, which can further help our decision making.

One of the things that I find cool is that so many things in life fall into an 80/20 split. It's common to find that 20% of our customers provide 80% of our revenue. (Or, how about do 20% of our customers give us 80% of our headaches…) Markets have a tendency to split up in this way too – with the market leader getting 80% of the market, with a strong following brand taking 20%. 

We see this everywhere – Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Aldi and Lidl, BMW and Mercedes, BBC and ITV, FedEx, and UPS. Pretty much any brand space you can divide in this way. 

Of course, there are spaces that don't work quite like this, and in any brand space there are often lots of other small companies fighting over the scraps.

When we look at the IT market, if we're struggling to make a decision we can usually get a "mostly right" decision by identifying the "Coca-Cola and Pepsi" players. For example, for your laptop do you want to run Windows, or macOS? (Or do you go for a "supermarket cola" like Linux?)

Other common pairings in this space are Microsoft 365 (aka Office 365), or G Suite? iOS or Android?  HP or Brother? Vodafone or EE? Intel or AMD? Ubiquti or Ruckus? Window Server or Linux? AWS or Azure? SQL Server or Oracle? Time and time again we see this pattern emerge.

This thought tool can be practically useful in two ways. Firstly, if someone is trying to sell us something, we can ask them to provide a "Coca-Cola and Pepsi" choices. If there is only one option on the table, why has *that* option and only that option been selected for presentation to you, the customer. There are virtually no markets in IT where there is only one option to be considered.

Secondly, if there are too many choices, it tells you that there is something "wrong" with the market. A place where we see this today with IT for SMEs is the CRM – customer relationship management – space. There are scores of vendors selling CRM systems to SMEs – and it's absolutely essential that every SME has a CRM within their business, so this is a market that you need to navigate.

In the large corporate space, there is a Coca-Cola/Pepsi choice in CRM – you should choose either Salesforce.com or Microsoft Dynamics. In the SME space, I can reel of Insightly, Zoho, Pipedrive, Capsule, Hubspot, Apptivo, SugarCRM, and if you were to ask me today to choose one of them, I could not do this safely. A market that looks like this is one that is due to consolidation – jump forward to 2025 and we'll know who the Coca-Cola and Pepsi are. (I suspect Hubspot will be one of them, if for no other reason than their market reach is so strong, for what it's worth.) What happens to the SME that chooses a CRM only to find the product gets extinguished during that consolidation process.

In summary then, taking yesterday and today, do what everyone else does and follow the trend, and pick where you can from the two strongest players in the market. Do this, and you largely won't go wrong. We'll come back to this CRM issue, but that is one of the most important pieces to get right, but frustratingly one of the most difficult pieces to get right.

Take care,
Matt
