# Thought #18: SharePoint
[Home](/)

Hi,

In thought 18 of "30 IT Thoughts", we're going to look at SharePoint.

In 2021, SharePoint will be 20 years old, and for me as an IT professional, it's hard to think of a more misunderstood, weird product in Microsoft's line-up that has lasted that long. 

SharePoint was designed to allow large corporates to build internal intranet websites that would act as a central repository of all the company's information. The use case was based on the principle that some businesses are so large that you don't know who knows what or who has which skills – the logic then following that if you build an internal facing website you can record all of that information and from there the whole company can benefit by being able to "mine" that central store of knowledge.

The original versions of SharePoint were horrendously expensive, because of this particular use case and focus on large corporates.

How you are *supposed* to use SharePoint is by "modelling" the organisation in a collection of websites (just called "sites" in SharePoint) – so HR might have one site within SharePoint that looks and works as they need it, sales might have another, operations yet another, etc. This metaphor of use – that each department or unit within a department is supposed to have their own site is how SharePoint is supposed to be used.

Except now, everyone is supposed to use SharePoint from small one-person businesses, all the way up to governments. We're, of course, more interested in the SME side of this. Oh, and when I say "everyone", OneDrive under the hood is actually just SharePoint – so when you create your free Outlook.com email account, you're actually getting a single person/single site SharePoint.

With business licenses of Microsoft 365 you get two server licenses – Exchange (which does email), and SharePoint. This means that any organisation on Microsoft 365 automatically has SharePoint.

As we've touched on a few times, it's essential that as a business – unless you have a really good reason not to – you store your files in the cloud. It reduces cost, increased resilience, increases agility, allows more modern ways of working, etc. What this really means that if you are a business who uses Microsoft 365, you should be using SharePoint to store your files.

This is where we get an "impedance mismatch" – i.e. what we have is mixed metaphors. As SMEs, we don't have this sort of "global discovery" problem that SharePoint is designed to solve; we don't have departments, and complex working groups, etc. Plus, we also are used to storing files in folder structures, with a central (usually mapped) network drive with folders like Sales, HR, Clients, etc.

If we look at how Google Drive works (or even iCloud, Dropbox or – ironically – basic OneDrive) we see something that looks more like a file system. We intuitively can understand those much more easily than we can understand SharePoint.

The trick with SharePoint as an SME is to "think big or go home". If you were a large corporate, as mentioned you would "model" the organisation as a series of top-level sites within SharePoint (i.e. you'd create sites for each major business unit or department), and within that you would customise SharePoint to do what you needed. You can do all that with an SME – you just don't have the same imperative, because the business units and/or departments are not as explicitly organised as they are within a corporate.

It would be a mistake to look at SharePoint and use it like a "giant OneDrive" – for example, by creating one site for your business and just dumping files into that site like it were Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, or (again) a giant OneDrive. What you want to try and do is create separate sites for each thing.

A good starter for ten for an SME is to create sites within SharePoint for each distinct customer, supplier, and partner – so if you wanted to find the files for XYZ customer, you go to the XYZ site. To find files for the ABC site, you go to the ABC site, and so on. 

This reason for doing this is that as the business gets larger, you can customise SharePoint site templates to optimise the way you engage with each of those entities. So you can create a customer site that not only has files for the customer, but it might integrate in with the CRM, show calendaring and project information, help desk tickets from the helpdesk software, and so on. SharePoint *isn't* a system just for storing files – it's a way of building quite complex applications specific to any and every different use case the business has to support.

This is the real difference and value that comes from SharePoint when we stop thinking about it as just another cloud-based file storage system. 

Take care,
Matt
