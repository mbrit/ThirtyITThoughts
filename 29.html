# Thought #29: Bringing it all together, Part 1
[Home](/)

Hi,

Nearly there – today and the next day bring us to the end of the "30 IT Thoughts" programme. In these two parts, we're going to bring everything together.

Let's start by thinking about why I put this programme together, which I'll appreciate you don't know until I tell you! 

If you look at you or any one of the people who've been through this programme, you will have a certain capability in terms of IT in your business compared to everyone else. If you examine the capabilities of your peers, you will be "better" than some in terms of IT capability, and "worse" than others.

We can take that one step further in that if we apply something like "the law of large numbers", if you look at enough companies and measure and quantify each of their capabilities in some way, you will able to create a number of "capability classes" that occur naturally. This happens in any activity that we undertake, either as a business, or personally. Do this enough, and with enough sophistication, you can label and benchmark these classes, such that it's possible to point to and examine any business and say that they are at "Level 1", and you may then point at a peer of theirs and be able to say that they are at "Level 2" or "Level 3".

With this quantified classification and benchmarking, you are then able to determine common pathways that people tend to follow as they "level up". With those pathways defined, it's possible to determine common obstacles, and as such come up with not only a map of how you get from Level 1 to Level 2 to Level 3, but also annotate on that map where obstacles are, routes around, or mitigation steps if a route around cannot be determined. Do this enough and you come up with a "technology capability model".

If you look at large businesses, they tend to either have or strive for very capable and competent IT within those businesses. Regardless of what the levels on the model are named or mean, there is always a desire to "level up" because there is always business advantage in levelling up. Going right back to the beginning – IT is a toolkit for innovation, IT allows you to do what your competition cannot, or allow you to get so far ahead of competition that you genuinely create a new market or industry. Most importantly, IT systems allow companies to make data-driven decisions, which in combination with the intuitive leaps that senior people in the organisation can make when they genuinely know and genuinely understand their market – it's *this* part that makes the difference between an average company and a spectacular one.

For me, as an IT specialist who "leans in" specifically to help small-to-medium businesses, I know that SMEs don't think about their IT in the same way that a large organisation does. Most SMEs look at IT as nothing more than a communication tool – primarily email, sometimes social media, often both supported by a website. In terms of IT capability, most SMEs sit at this, which here we'll call Level 1.

If you look at the way that IT is sold to SMEs, the strategies employed by IT vendors towards SMEs focus almost entirely on security products. This can be described as Level 2 – the awareness that risks exist in terms of data, and that additional technology products combined with process and procedures can control and ameliorate that risk. But this is largely where IT vendors stop, because it's difficult to couch marketing messages for SMEs that are anything but "fear, uncertainty, and doubt" – "you need this product because malware will end your business", or "you need this product because a disgruntled employee with your social media passwords can cause reputational damage", and so on. This is essentially the only market accessible route, because SME owners are generally not tuned in to a different way of operating.

Level 1 can actually be quite dangerous – I talk at least on SME each week that completely ignores the safety capability that comes with Level 2 and is perfectly fine with their IT because they use "Macs and Microsoft 365". 

The point of this programme, as we get right to the end, is to create an awareness in your mind that there are levels above Level 2. I said in my promotional materials for this programme that it's designed, over 30 days, to let ideas around IT propagate up. I hope that's exactly where you are having read the above, and if you're sitting there asking, "OK, but what is Level 3?" and "How many levels are there?!" then that should show the process has worked. It doesn't matter what those levels are – if I've managed to get you to understand that there is more than Level 2, my work is done.

Specifically, there's no reason why a small-to-medium business can't have the same IT capability as a large organisation, and all the attendant benefits that that brings in order to grow the business, keep it and its employees and owners safe, and allow you to create jumping off points to truly innovate and do something really special. We'll try and bring all that together tomorrow in the last part of this programme.

Take care,
Matt
