# Thought #20: Don’t have nightmares
[Home](/)

Hi,

In thought 20 of “30 IT Thoughts”, we’re going to be referencing on the motto of Nick Ross: don’t have nightmares – or, “just because a lot of things can go wrong with our IT, that doesn’t mean it will”.

IT is an industry that has “risk management” at its core. Cut any IT professional in half and “Yeah, but what if…” will be written through them like a stick of rock. On the one hand, we in the industry have to look after and protect data, an asset that has always been of value – that is our core job. On the other hand, IT systems have always been expensive, and as such we’re always concerned about pitching the wrong solution and wasting the customer’s money. Both of these factors combined makes IT an industry that this is quite buttoned-up and cautious. It also makes us likely to look at any potential scenario from a “what can go wrong” perspective.

For SMEs, this exhibits itself in an approach from IT vendors to the SME market as one that contains a good deal of FUD – fear, uncertainty, or doubt. A lot of products get marketed positioned with messages like: “do you fear getting infected by ransomware?”, “are you sure your backups are working?”, “can you keep hackers out?”, and so on.

This risk stuff is important – computers do go wrong, people do get sold the wrong things, and bad things will happen if you lose or leak data. But all of this risk is very controllable, and it’s worth just bringing together the threads of the other two themes that we’ve looked at in this programme before we forget about them: i.e. 1) we already mentioned “risk”, 2) IT as a toolbox for innovation, and 3) there’s more than one way to shave a yak (“efficiency”).

Whilst we have to understand risk with regards to IT, because there is such a top-down bias from the industry in terms of fixating on risk, it’s worth just checking that this isn’t an area that we too are fixating on – that we have the headspace to lift up our chins a little bit and look out to the horizon. We have to get just the *right amount* of effort into that risk management piece – get things set-up through policy, procedures, and culture so that when things go wrong they really go wrong. A way to look at this is that things should only go wrong when “all the holes in the Swiss cheese line up”, i.e. ordinarily the “holes” aren’t a problem, it’s only when the stars align and you get your “cheese” in just the wrong position that it all goes to custard (if you’ll excuse the dairy analogy).

This is how large organisations manage their IT, and a central tenet of this programme is to look at how we can get our SME IT working like the big businesses. Know the risks, implement what you can to pinch off those risks, and hopefully the “Swiss cheese hole alignment problem” goes away.

In terms of the other two themes then, these can be approached in similar – yet distinct – ways. In terms of finding new ways to do things, we’re looking to be mindful of the things within the business that can be (cheaply, ideally) fixed for efficiency wins. A really common one in SMEs is that when people are taking laptops home, the power sockets are on the floor, and everyone who starts and ends the day has to scrabble around plugging and unplugging. Putting a mains extension lead on the desk turns this 30-second faff into a two-second barely noticed tasks, all for the cost of £10 a desk. Again, it’s not just about looking through a list of things that can go wrong, it’s building a culture within the business that is looking out for these points of constriction where with a little bit of work can increase flow or stop militating against flow.

Of course, as we started off this programme, the big win comes from innovation. Once we’ve done enough to manage the risk (through policy, procedures, and culture), and once we’ve looked at how to remove points of constriction to create little pockets of efficiency, what can we do within our business to do something genuinely unique, something that our competitors/peers genuinely cannot do that can really drive that resilience and adaptability within our businesses.

Take care,
Matt
