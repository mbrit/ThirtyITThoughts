# Thought #25: Nuts and bolts
[Home](/)

Hi,

Welcome to thought 25 of "30 IT Thoughts". 

When I set out to write this programme, I wanted to make sure that it facilitated thinking about how and why we buy IT and deploy it within our business, rather than "what" we buy. The issue with writing about "what" is that it stops being a reflective programme about possibilities and starts being a sales programme. But, there are baseline things that every SME should deploy, and it is possible to say to pretty much any SME that if they buy X, Y, and Z they'll almost always get good results. (You can pretty much say this any business of any size, albeit some of the X, Y, and Z components will change.) As such, even in a reflective programme, it's fair to me to say that there are some specific things that you need. As we get to the end of the programme and we start really trying to formulate a picture of our ideal end goal, this baseline "scaffolding" within which we build out our systems is easy to set out.

As we covered before, I'm a great believer in offering "Coca-Cola and Pepsi" choices, so let's start there with our "groupware". Our basic email, calendaring, and contacts application should be either a choice of Microsoft 365 or Google G Suite. It would generally be a mistake in terms of cost/benefit to choose anything else. My view these days is that Microsoft 365 should be preferred, because every business needs the Microsoft Office apps and you might as well lump in with one vendor – but there's nothing wrong with the "Pepsi" choice of G Suite. 

Second, you should use Windows PCs or Apple Macs as the main "daily drivers" for the knowledge workers in your business. iPads can be used to support some main tasks, and sometimes you find that businesses have one or more owners/directors using an iPad because they don't need a PC. This is OK, in small doses. Chromebooks should be avoided because their supported use cases are too narrow for use in a "normal" SME.

Third, unless you have unusual needs – which usually means that you work with very large files – your files should be stored in the cloud. For reasons I'll come onto, your cloud file storage system should match your groupware choice. If you use Microsoft 365, store your files in SharePoint; if you use G Suite, store your files in Google Drive. Your company files should not be stored in Dropbox, iCloud, or (personal) OneDrive. These systems provide synchronisation of files between users – they are not a storage solution per se. NAS devices and file servers should be avoided.

Fourth, your cloud systems need backing up, as there's nothing to stop someone malicious or erroneously deleting your emails or files. Because we have put our files with our groupware provider, all we need is a cloud-to-cloud backup provider, such as Spanning, or Backupify. These services connect to your Microsoft 365 "tenant" or your G Suite account and download and store, nightly, a complete copy of your organisation's email and files. This should be enough to make you secure, but you may also want a "belt and braces" approach of backing up the actual devices as well. If you want to do this, my recommendation here is Backblaze or Jungle Disk. If you use an on-premises (i.e. non-cloud) accounts system (or any other on-premises software), the computer used for that should be backed up separately using Backblaze, Jungle Disk, or a similar tool.

You will also need a managed process/procedure in-house to regularly check and confirm that the backups are working.

Fifth, your CRM should become the single most important piece of software in your business. We'll touch on this more at the end of the programme as we start trying to visualise the sorts of systems and solutions that we could put into place if we were minded to. CRM choice right now is risky as there are too many vendors, which suggests that the market will consolidate. However, you need one at the centre of your business. Large organisations would choose between Microsoft Dynamics and Salesforce.com – and over time if your goal is to grow your SME to be a large business you will likely ultimately end up with one of these. My personal preference at the lower end of the market is Capsule.

Sixth, there is risk to your business in loss or theft of devices. Apart from ethical considerations related to customer data, losing a device means having to declare that fact to customers, partners, and regulatory/oversight bodies. As such, all devices need to be encrypted. Windows will do this as standard, if you have Windows 10 Pro – you will need to go in and enable BitLocker. If you have Windows 10 Home, you should upgrade, or use Becrypt, which is a longstanding product with a good reputation. Apple users will find that macOS has encryption as standard – in this case you have to go in and enable FileVault.

Seventh, you do not need third-party antivirus or anti-malware products. Windows 10 security should be enabled. If you are desperate to use/very much stuck with Windows 8, use an enterprise antivirus product, such as Symantec Endpoint Security, rather than a retail product. If you're using Windows 7 or earlier, you need to immediately stop and find a way to scrap the machine or upgrade oit.

Eighth, everyone in the business should be using a password manager – LastPass or 1Password are both excellent. Passwords should not be reused – and if you really need to share a password and your password manager is a faff to use, share the passwords over WhatsApp, as this is end-to-end encrypted and secure.

Ninth, you should be running the most up-to-date version of everything – operating systems (Windows, macOS), and any applications that you install. Devices should be configured to automatic download and install operating system updates. You should use strong passwords everywhere, and be very distrustful of email attachments and links in emails.

Tenth, and finally, communications-wise, your phone system should be a "VoIP" or internet telephony solution. The one that I recommend is 8x8, but in any case you should prefer to have your own solution that you provision yourself, rather than one offered to you by any office building you happen to be in. (The flexibility of managing this yourself is invaluable.) Related to this is that Zoom and Microsoft Teams should be used in concert, rather than preferring one to another – and at this point you can skip any other provides of videoconferencing. Microsoft Teams is best for teams within the business and/or communication with partners/suppliers where there is an ongoing relationship. Zoom is frankly excellent for ad hoc meetings – expect to see this end up replacing telephones in the long-term.

I'm quite happy that turned out to be a round number of ten steps – but regardless of the number of items in the list, that is the basics of how to set-up an SMEs IT. If you do all that like that, you'll have excellent "scaffolding" on which to innovate.

Take care,
Matt
