# Thought #21: A (very) quick PC buyer’s guide
[Home](/)

Hi,

In thought 21 of “30 IT Thoughts”, we’re going to take a 30,000-foot view at the subject of buying PCs. These thoughts will be about Windows PCs, but you can apply the same concepts to Macs.

What I’ve been keen to do with this programme is try and demystify the way the IT industry works and how it positions itself by linking industry behaviour out to other, more day-to-day scenarios. We can do the same by comparing the market for PCs to the market for cars.

The car market has a huge number of vendors, and each vendor offers a range of products so that all together the total constellation of products offered covers every possible buyer. In reality, the large choice of products isn’t strictly necessary, as you can cover the vast majority of car use cases with a a much smaller number of products. You can cover most people’s car transport *needs* with something like a Ford Focus or Vauxhall Astra, as these models offer the greatest utility and versatility. The car market though, as we intuitively understand, likes to sell on *wants*, not needs, and so the proliferation of car makes and models can be put down to servicing the wants that fall outside of the strict use cases, or needs that are outliers.

The PC market is shaped in a very similar way, in that we see a vast array of products from a ton of vendors. But like most people car’s needs can be addressed by a small subset of products, most people computer’s needs can be addressed in much the same way.

Luckily, there’s even some helpful overlaps. 

A computer comprises a processor, some memory, and a disk, contained with some sort of chassis. Peripherals, a keyboard and mouse is required to input information, and a monitor is required to output information. We either configure this lot in a small portable chassis (a laptop), or a larger, semi-portable chassis (a desktop). A PC, when sold, is just some configuration of these five or six components.

If you were looking to build your own computer from scratch, you’d find similar “mini markets” as you do for whole “pre-built” computers. If we look at just the processor side, the first thing we have a Coca-Cola and Pepsi market split between two manufacturers: Intel, and AMD. (Intel is the dominant brand, and AMD is the challenger, but both are equally good.) Second thing we see is that the core of their processor line-up follows the same model numbering scheme as BMW – we have the Intel i3 and AMD Ryzen 3, Intel i5 and AMD Ryzen 5, Intel i7 and AMD Ryzen 7. This is, to be honest, a massive oversimplification, but I think this suffices for our purposes here.

The allusion to BMW’s numbering scheme is helpful because if you want a decent, workhorse like BMW, you might be inclined to go with a 5-series. You might think that the 3-series doesn’t quite have enough “oomph”, and you might think the 7-series is a bit flashy. (Consider also the Audi A4, Audi A6, and Audi A8 – Coke and Pepsi vendors, same overlap of products.) We see the same pattern on processors choice – that the i3/Ryzen 3 don’t have enough oomph, the i5/Ryzen 5 are workhorse like, and the i7/Ryzen 7 are overkill. 

That’s one of the five components sorted, when we look at memory, this often comes configured as 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB. For most purposes, 4GB is not enough, 8GB is pretty much right, and 16GB is overkill. And again on disk space – 250B is too little, 500GB is about right, and 1TB (1000GB) is too much. 

So, trying to configure our PC as “what’s the rough equivalent of a BMW 5-series”, or “what’s a little more than cheap and a little less than luxury”, we land on an Intel i5 (or AMD Ryzen 5), with 8GB RAM, and a 500GB disk. That configuration of PC will absolutely do for most people as it covers the vast majority of non-specialist use-cases. 

A word of warning, it is absolutely essential to buy a laptop with a SSD (solid state drive) rather than a HDD (a hard disk drive, or mechanical/spinning disk.)

With those three core components dialled in – the peripherals and monitors/screens come down to personal choice. 

Armed with just that one piece of knowledge – that you can largely ignore the periphery of the market and simply zero-in on the one decent workhorse “daily driver” specification – if you do find yourself trying to buy a PC on Amazon or Currys PC World, or wherever, you are so much more likely to get a decent PC that will work for you if you just say “i5/8GB/500GB SSD – don’t care what brand”. You’ll spend about £650-£750 (including VAT), but you should then be sorted for the next 5-7 years. 

You can do the same trick with Apple’s line-up as well, although a new MacBook Pro with that specification as of writing will cost you £1,500.

Take care,
Matt
