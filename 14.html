# Thought #14: How to win at cybersecurity
[Home](/)

Hi,

In thought 14 of “30 IT Thoughts”, we’re going to turn our attention to cybersecurity.

This is a sufficiently big topic that a good chunk of the IT industry is looking to sell you cybersecurity products. But, in reality the basics of cybersecurity are pretty straightforward, and if you do these five simple things you are most of the way there.

The issue that causes the most damage to a business, but which is the most difficult to mitigate is the ransomware attack. In this sort of attack, automated systems roam the internet looking for computers that can be infected. Once infected, the ransomware will encrypt all of the data on the computer, stopping you from accessing your data until you pay the ransomware authors fee. The fact that this process is indiscriminate and highly automated is what keeps me awake at night – there isn’t anything about a ransomware victim that makes them a victim, other than they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. If you don’t protect yourself against this sort of attack, given enough time you will fall foul of it.

The steps that we’re going to go through apply generally for both desktop/laptop computers and smartphones, and all of this applies to all categories of “malware” (ransomware, and other viruses). We tend to worry about ransomware more as – well, the hackers have to make a living and ransomware provides a commercial benefit that tells us this class of malware will only become more prevalent.

Job 1 is that you have to make sure that you are using the latest version of your operating system, and any applications that you have installed. Malware will look to use bugs in software running on your computer in order to install itself – software developers know this, and will continually roll out patches to stop the “vectors” that malware use to install itself. Latest versions of the software means no vectors. Pay particular attention to software that is out-of-support, as this means that they no longer receive security updates and you will be particular exposed.

Job 2 is that you have to make sure that you are using strong passwords, and not reusing passwords – each thing that you log into, whether that’s a website or a computer, should have a separate password. This more or less dictates that you should be using a password manager. These are small utilities and apps that maintain a secure list of your passwords. They take a little getting used to, but they are invaluable. A good product to use is LastPass, which is free.

Job 3 is to make sure that, if you’re using Windows 10, you have Windows Security enabled. Unless you have very specialist needs (and SMEs typically don’t have this sort of very specialist need), you do not need a third-party antivirus product. The economics of computer systems sales being what they are, there is a rich market in antivirus vendors paying PC manufacturers to install products like McAfee and Norton on new computers, which is more useful to them as suppliers than it is to you as a customer. Windows Security in Windows 10 is generally good enough. 

Job 4 is do not click on email links or attachments unless you absolutely know they are safe. The number one way in which malware can get a foothold within your business is via this route. If you simply build a culture around teaching people not to trust emails because of the infection risk, you’re going to be doing much better than most people and taking great steps in protecting yourself and your business. 

Job 5 is, as we’ve managed a lot of times, backup… backup… backup, and make sure that your backups can be restored. This particularly applies to a ransomware attack, as the best way to recover from a ransomware attack is to wipe the infected machine and restore from backup.

These five aspects together get you most of the way there with regards to cybersecurity. It’s not the whole picture, but these are aspects that you can bake into your policies and procedures internally and be in good stead.

Take care,
Matt
