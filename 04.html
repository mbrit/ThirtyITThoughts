# Thought 4: IT is like plumbing
[Home](/)

Hi,

Over the first three days of "30 IT Thoughts", we've been looking at relatively conceptual, blue-sky stuff. We've looked at why people buy IT, we've through about innovation, and we've thought about how a business can be data-driven. 

In this fourth thought, we're going to be a little more "nuts and bolts", or more properly pipes and… valves (?) and turn our attention to the maxim that within a business *the IT should be like plumbing* -- i.e. you need it, but you should only notice it when it goes wrong.

As an industry, IT professionals like to think that there is something special and amazing about computers and what we do, and we tend to try and present the industry and our work as such. The reality is that really good computer systems underpin and support businesses but that they should have a purely background role. A computer system that you notice is one that you don't want, in the same way that (and I'll use a slightly nicer plumbing metaphor here), a leaking pipe focuses time an attention in exactly the same way a non-leaking pipe does not.

There is a terrifying amount of technology that powers Amazon, but no customer of there's a) really cares, or b) should need to know anything about how it works. Open a web page, find what you want, add to basket/click "checkout", done. 

That is how the IT should work in your business. You and your employees in particular – but this also applies to your customers – you should not notice the IT that you're using, it should simply facilitate what you do.

When things aren't working, it's very obvious – at least to the person that it's happening to. A common theme in IT is that people are used to IT not working properly and tend to struggle and put up with it rather than tell management that it's broken. This can be disastrous if it happens to a customer ("I couldn't place the order on your website, so I went to your competitor!"), but can also be either frustrating or ultimately also disastrous if it happens to an employee. An employee who is futzing around with an IT system that isn't working properly isn't an employee who is bringing their creativity to bear on the business generally.

What we need to do here is look at culture. Internally, it can become everyone's job to *keep* IT uninteresting and unimportant by being able to flag up and steer fixes for IT systems that don't work as well as they could, either because they are broken or improvements (innovation?) is apparently. Externally, we can "bake in" to the business enough analytics, intelligence, or others so that we know when customers are being frustrated. When we know, we can act.

Take care,
Matt
