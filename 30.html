# Thought #30: Bringing it all together (part 2)
[Home](/)

Hi,

In the final thought of “30 IT Thoughts”, we’re going to tie up all the threads that we’ve spoken about into a final summary that should let us look back on the journey. 

If you recall on how I set out this programme when I asked you to sign up, I said that the purpose was to see what will “propagate up” if we just had a quick moment to reflect on how IT might work within our businesses over a reasonable period of time. As we’ve seen, there are some things about IT that we don’t really need to think about – how we do email, document storage, cybersecurity, backups, etc – all the nuts and bolts stuff is really obvious and easy, and there are literally scores of people out there who can help with that, and it’s very difficult to get wrong. (I hope my “Coca-Cola and Pepsi” concept for vendor selection stands out, as I use that day-to-day, and I feel that’s particularly straightforward and helpful.)

As I said in the last email, the trick is to get into a mindset where we’re looking at our IT as if it were the IT in a larger business. If you don’t have first-hand experience of how to implement an IT strategy in a large business, I accept that can be a tricky ask, but there are some basic precepts that can help, all of which we’ve covered there and about. At it’s core, the principle is to remember that IT is “information technology”, and as such it is concerned about “information”, or rather “data”. Rather like the film “The Matrix” where Neo eventually can see the universe what it is – green code running down the screen in his mind’s eye – data within your business is everywhere. Everything that happens consumes and/or creates data, and as all data can be analysed and acted upon, it follows that everything that happens in our business can be transformed into and/or expressed as data and measured. Once we’re able to measure, we are able to optimise. It is that activity that moves IT from being about “communication” (basically, email), and turns it into a technology that you can use within your business.

Optimisation can apply either to improve something that is already being done – do more of what is working, do less of what is not, but can also be used to do something that is not already being done. If you manage to optimise to a point where you are doing something that no one else is doing (no matter how small), you are to anyone’s definition achieving *innovation*.

As we said right back at the beginning, anyone can innovate. IT is nothing more than a toolkit for innovation, and it’s likely that you already have within your business the stuff that you need to innovate. You only need some way of recording the data (and Excel or Word will do), a culture that is tilted towards turning the business into a “data-driven organisation”, an understanding of what it is that you do and how you do it (in order to optimise flow and workflow), and some good old fashioned intuitive leaps – this being the kind of creative thinking that comes with an entrepreneurial mindset. Whilst it’s important to encourage people who work for us to apply creative and innovative thinking to what is going on in the business, because the owners are so much more invested emotionally and financially, the innovation really has to start with the owners.

Of course, if you want to do more than that, if you really want to lean in and make your IT core in your business, then you are talking about CRM systems, robotic process automation (software robots), bespoke software code and integrations that streamline data transformations across the whole business, and so on – but really these are just incremental improvements on the basics, i.e. they are optimisation and innovations in and of themselves.

I do genuinely hope that you have had as much fun and satisfaction in reading this programme as I have in writing it. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end, and take care.

Matt
