# Thought 5: Trends and popularity
[Home](/)

Hi,

In the fifth thought of "30 IT Thoughts", we're going to look at the role that trends have to play in IT strategy.

On the face of it, making purchasing decisions in IT seems difficult and complex. The market presents itself as (needlessly) technically dense, there appears to be a plethora of products to choose from, and the impact of making the wrong choice is significant pain. In reality, only one of those three factors is correct – wrong choices do cause (usually significant) pain, but the market is much less technically complex and much more "choice-poor" than it looks.

If you simply do what everyone else does, in the vast majority of cases you will get it right, or right enough.

There are plenty of edge cases, which we'll get to as we go on, but for now the way to consider the way that IT works is like it is a series of waves crashing on a beach. There is always a wave that is receding, a wave that is building out in the distance, and one that is current. Thirteen years ago – in 2007 – the iPhone was introduced. At the time, everyone had BlackBerry devices, and no one had an iPhone or Android phone. Two years later, no one had a BlackBerry device, and everyone had an iPhone or Android phone. One wave recedes, another replaces it – the replacement though operates on a broad, wholesale level – the old approach gets (typically) utterly obliterated.

The point here is that if you just make sure you are in whatever wave everyone else is in, you'll have the general shape of the solution right. Right now, in the middle of whatever COVID-19 is doing to society over and above is direct physiological effects, we know that some waves are coming in, and some waves are coming out. At a very minimum, we'll probably now see a long-term establishment of a preference for online meetings for project updates and other types of meetings where relationship building is not the goal (i.e. sales and business development). 

This approach gives you a general shape of strategy – determine the waves, and determine the strategy. For example, most people use cloud computing, most people either have or are moving to VoIP telephony/internet telephony, most people use laptops rather than desktops, most people use Windows rather than macOS. (Apologies to any die-hard Apple fans – I'm just stating the numbers!) With a blank sheet of paper, we can say, "OK, I need a Windows laptop, a VoIP phone, and I need to store my data in the cloud and use cloud applications on subscription" – no real thought required.

We've spoken a lot so far about innovation – this is key. Your effort and expense on innovation should not be spent on this baseline stuff. As time moves on, technology has an accretive effect that benefits everyone who is able to buy into the wave that introduces it – you need to use this "wave" method to build up your technology inline with everyone else, and then use that same baseline where everyone is as a platform to base your innovation on. That way you a) get the benefits that everyone else is getting from scale, and b) you only need a little bit of leverage and don't need to reinvent the wheel to achieve your goals.

Take care,
Matt
