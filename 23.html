# Thought #23: Bruce Lee
[Home](/)

Hi,

In thought 23 of “30 IT Thoughts” we’re going to look at workflow and process. I’m not a big fan of quoting people, but there’s a quote that I like from Bruce Lee where he talks about the fact that he was never in fear of the person who had practiced 10,000 different kicks once, but was in fear of the person who practiced the same kick 10,000 times.

This is talking to the idea that it’s better to have a repertoire of a small number of things that are practiced and optimised to great effect over and above having a repertoire of a large number of things that are called upon for occasional use. Usually this quote is attributed to matters of personal growth and development.

When we look at workflow within our organisations, we can consider the topic from two perspectives – our personal workflow (how we organise and “execute” our own work), and company/organisation or group workflow (usually seen as process and procedures). An organisation’s group workflow – because work is done through orchestration of activities undertaken by people – by definition has to be a function of multiple individual workflows working together. Therefore we can look at individual-level workflows as having an impact on the performance of organisation-level workflows, and vice versa.

Businesses that make physical things – either from the ground-up or by assembly of parts – tend to think about optimising their workflows because the actual process of manufacturing a “good” is not abstract, i.e. it’s physical in nature and is obviously “there”. It is clear when things go wrong when you have a production line, as you’ll see things like accidents, product not going out, raw material building up, etc. However, whilst not all businesses make physical things, all businesses undertake knowledge work. Because there is a lack of physicality to knowledge work, it is not as clear when the workflow is not working well. Better yet, there is an expectation within a lot of businesses that “computers are a pain”, and as such problems with IT systems – i.e. problems with information-based workflows – can get overlooked.

To come back to Bruce Lee’s maxim, a company that manufactures windows will think about how to produce the same window 10,000 times whilst looking to optimise that process to gain efficiency. This idea is, after all, that “kick number 10,000” will be substantially more effective than “kick number 1”. (Bruce would not fear “kick number 1” even if his opponent intended to practice is 10,000 or even 100,000 times.) What our manufacturing company might not do with the same intentionality is look at how to undertake the knowledge-based activities it needs to do with the same end goal of optimisation. When “window number 10,000” goes out of the loading bay door there’s a good chance that collecting the payment for the related “invoice number 10,000” isn’t as optimised. Or the process to produce and close “proposal number 10,000” is just as haphazard and vague as the process used to create “proposal number 1”.

IT has always been billed as a magic technology that increases efficiency. However, what efficiency you get from any IT system when you take it out of the box tends to make us lazy because we get this immediate quick win that solves some problem that we have. A word processor allows us to write more efficiently than a typewriter, an email is more efficient than a fax. Google AdWords are more efficient than newspaper ads. The issue is that these markets are open to everyone, and everyone gets these advantages. 

What we need to do then is look at how we can optimise the workflow using the tools that are accessible to everyone. (This is especially true for SMEs who do not typically have the money for weird IT investments that other people don’t have – we all tend to buy the same things.) 

Bruce Lee’s maxim hides some complexity in that he talks about practicing “a kick”, but he doesn’t talk about how to choose what that kick is. You might practice a kick that very effectively wins the match, but only applies in 5% of the matches that you partake in – whereas someone else might practice a kick that applies is 95% of the matches. 

Choosing where to “kick” in this context means a) looking at your individual workflows and b) looking at organisational workflows where they feed into and feed back from each other. You need to find a small number of kicks that you can practice 10,000 times within those workflows. Because IT systems are so abstract, it can be hard to see where optimisations can be done. The easiest way to do this is to assume that everything can be optimised and unpack every part of every workflow to fully understand it, and fully understand where IT can “flex” and lean into creating these optimisation wins.

Take care,
Matt
