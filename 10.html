# Thought 10: Solutions Looking for Problems
[Home](/)


Hi,

In thought 10 of "30 IT Thoughts", we're going to look at a common trope within the IT industry.

Previously we spoke about trends, and generational shifts. We said that trends were useful in understanding the market, in that if we follow trends we tend to get it right most of the time, and we also said there are these generational shifts where everything changes overnight. 

That thought was from the buyer's perspective, but there's a flip-side from the seller's perspective – namely that if you as a producer of a new technology can position yourself for that shift, you tend to do very well. Microsoft, for example, owned the whole computer landscape before it was upended by iOS and Android smartphones, and now Apple and Google dominate that space. Bad for Microsoft, but great for Apple and Google.

Again from the seller's perspective, because there is this obvious advantage in being at the beginning of the curve, technology companies tend to – there's no better way to put this – become delusional about what they are doing and kid themselves that they are positioning themselves at the start of some new wave that will make them multibillionaires. They will go out there and say what they are doing is going to be the "new hotness" and the next big thing, etc, even though what they end up producing turns out to be a damp squib. If enough companies in a space do this, they can create their own "pseudo-trend" that gets a lot of airtime, but is actually rubbish. 

Schadenfreude aside, in the process of the market working out that a vendor or vendors have built things that delivers no value, they usually manage to sell quite a lot of rubbish, and those end customers who don't see it coming waste money. That's my concern here – that we need to be more attuned to being sold something that doesn't deliver value. This is why I'm encouraging a basic strategy of working with and talking to our peers to determine what trends are emerging within our business communities and seeing for ourselves what solutions are delivering value.

The key hallmark to look out for here is the idea is the principle of a "solution looking for a problem". By way of an example, for the past 20 years, white goods manufacturers have been trying to sell fridges that connect to the internet and have a screen on them for the family to use to… um… view recipes, order groceries, [send tweets]( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/13/teen-smart-fridge-twitter-grounded), and… I don't know why someone would by a fridge that was connected to the internet. 

An area where we need to be careful is in the space of artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular machine learning. Right now, today, whilst AI has some very specific applications where it works extremely well, because it looks like the "new hotness", technology companies push the fact that something has AI in it as a benefit in and of itself. That push does not necessarily come direct to customers in the market like us – oftentimes the push goes to investors who then through that process give credibility to an unworthy solution. 

Every industry has a secret that it likes to keep to itself and not let outsiders know. I suspect IT has a few of these but a relevant one here is that we don't produce "silver bullets". The idea of a silver bullet is a technology that has some seemingly magical solution to some particularly difficult problem. Penicillin is a silver bullet – overnight it let doctors cure the incurable and was instantly transformative. We don't do that sort of solution within IT; we slowly and incrementally over time produce layers of technology that over time are transformative.

AI is dangerous here to SMEs in that the industry is going to want to position AI-based solutions as silver bullets, and this will create a mismatch between their purported value and their actual value. When we start to see this happen, many SMEs will get taken for a ride as those solutions almost certainly will not live up to the hype.

Take care,
Matt
