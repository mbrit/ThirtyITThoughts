# Thought #24: Software robots
[Home](/)

Hi,

In thought 24 of “30 IT Thoughts”, we’re going to talk about software robots.

In this programme, we’ve touched multiple times on ideas around workflow and innovation. We’ve also looked at how the industry tries to position itself in a way that “shows off” its supposed complexity, and that it can end up hyping “solutions looking for problems”. The topic of “robotic process automation”, or “RPA”, or more simply “software robots” walks a tricky line for SMEs because it’s genuinely useful, but is often overhyped.

When we talk about robots and/or artificial intelligence taking people’s jobs, the reality is that we will not see some universal machine that simulates a human either physically or intellectually. What we will see instead is certain functions becoming done by machines in a way that yields better results than having a human do it (for some value of “better”). If you’ve ever been to B&Q and seen a machine in there that’ll cut copies of keys for you *this* sort of machine that they are talking about – something specialised, and small that does the job in a way that is “better” (again, for some value of “better”) than going to Timpson’s.

The principle of software robots is that we can replace some functions within our business with small pieces of software that do some task that can either be a) already done by a human, and that human no longer has to do it, or b) needs to be done by a human but we don’t have, can’t find, or can’t afford a human to do it. A tricky line for me to walk in this as someone who runs an employment-centric social enterprise that on the one hand I want to see people creating jobs, but on the other hand have to propose to clients that certain job functions can be replaced by software. The way I balance this is that it’s OK to give robots tasks that are boring or mundane, as this creates opportunities for human employees to apply creativity. 

We have had basic software robots for pretty much the whole time the IT industry has been around. If you have a billing system that automatically emails invoices out to customers each months, that is a software robot – it’s replacing the function of a human that has to take a bunch of PDF’d invoices and email them out to your customers. 

What we can do as SMEs is use this point to “lean in” with regards to innovation. Virtually every repetitive, computer-based task can be automated, and some “dollar value” can be applied to any of those tasks to see if there is value in automation. That value will go up in line with creativity, especially if you can think of things that you wouldn’t necessarily want to pay someone at least a living wage to do. For example, I have a software robot that monitors my competitor’s social media posting and Google marketing, and so every day I can take a peek at just what my competitor’s are doing. I wouldn’t want to pay someone to do that every day – it’s not worth it for me. But a software robot can do this for me for free. 

So, one step is to look around your business and in the way that you might look for places in which the workflow can be improved, as we’ve discussed earlier, you might look for existing functions that can be automated with robots, or see if those existing functions act as jumping off points to other innovations. Then, how can those ideas be fitted into or used to improve workflow within the business.

A common place people look to implement software robots is marketing. You’ve almost certainly heard the term “marketing automation”. Marketing automation is an application of robotic process automation.

For an SME that is a non-technical business, there are two things to consider. Firstly, if you want this sort of system, you have to become an expert customer as software – particularly bespoke software solutions – are very risky and tricky to purchase. Secondly, the hype in this area is on the “very hyped” side of hype-y. In particular, suppliers will try and push artificial intelligence solutions in this area. I would struggle to think of an example where a normal SME need to use AI as part of any robotic process automation play. Again two reasons for this – a) most SMEs are simply not complicated enough to warrant application of machine intelligence to their day-to-day work, and b) AI solutions generally are overhyped.

To sum up then, look for places in the business where simple software robots can be used to perform repetitive tasks, taking the load off of you and your staff so that you can spend more time working and thinking creatively.

Take care,
Matt
