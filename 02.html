# Thought 2: What is “innovation”?
[Home](/)

Hi – welcome to the second of “30 IT Thoughts in 30 Days”.

Yesterday, we spoke about how IT was essential just a toolbox/box of tricks that can be used to deliver business innovation. This idea of “innovation” is going to be something that we think a lot about over the programme, as it’s this angle that allows us to set apart out businesses from our competitors. 

But what is “innovation”?

The definition of innovation that we’re going to use in this programme is about capabilities – specifically, what capability can we develop over and above our peers who run competing businesses. 

The reason why IT is so good at powering innovation is that because information is conceptual, rather than physical, it’s easily manipulatable. Any business can access the tools required to innovate with IT, because all you need is an understanding of your business model, a computer, some guidance, and some inspiration. (Hence why this programme is a thing.) It’s not like we have to develop a new jet engine and require a £1m aeronautical engineering workshop – we probably already have what we need. 

The majority of IT innovations within business are not particularly cool or flashy – at a basic level you can achieve a lot with small investments to take particularly painstaking, fiddly, and repetitive work off an employee and get some software to do it for you. I often think about my business as having a bunch of real people that do creative work, and a bunch of “software people” (agents, really) that do the mundane stuff. We all have processes in our business that demand this sort of repeated, robotic work.

This sort of innovation – where we offload manual, painstaking, and boring work off to some software – may not seem like much, but if we start doing that throughout the business we start to become much more agile. The capability that we are looking to build is that compared to our peers, we can do more with same money. We can serve more customers with the same staff, or we are less error-prone that our competitors because we’re focusing work that *needs* to be done by a human on a person, by giving portions of work to computers to do for us.

Plus, we want the people who work with us and for us in our business to be able to make contributions that are bold and imaginative, and so we want someone for 37.5 hours a week able to be able to bring creativity to their whole working week, not soaking up half their week on “robotic” work that we can innovate away.

This model is how we can innovate with IT without having to invent things – this isn’t about inventing some amazing process that no one else has, or a widget that we can take to market. It’s a target that’s much lower done, hence is much easier to hit – but it lets us run normal businesses with that increased agility and resilience which we’re looking to achieve.

Take care,
Matt
