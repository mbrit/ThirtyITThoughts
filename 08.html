# Thought 8: Backups (Part 1)
[Home](/)

Hi,

We’re now in the second week of “30 IT Thoughts” with thought 8, where we’re going to think about backups.

With my “IT services business” hat on, backups – or rather the *security* of backups – is the one thing that I get asked about most when working with a new customer. So, as we start to look at more practical issues in this programmes, we might as well start with backups.

Computers do not lose or corrupt information – if you put some data onto a computer system, it will remain in place, recorded perfectly, forever. Yet we lose or at risk of losing data all the time, because the rest of the universe has other ideas. The computer that you store your accounts on may catch fire. A frustrated ex-employee might log on and delete all of your emails. Working late one night and overly tired you might click the wrong button and delete the only copy of a novel you’ve been writing for 10 years. (Like everything in IT, it’s not the computer that’s the problem – it’s the user!) 

Backups don’t prevent the universe from messing with you, but they do allow you to lessen the impact of unexpected surprises. Essentially backups let you limit the amount of lost time to a small windows of time, as opposed to losing months or years of work. If you backup before leaving on a Monday night, and your computer catches fire Tuesday afternoon, you’ve only lost Tuesday morning’s work (and a computer – but hardware is typically easier to replace than data).

This tells us that the most important thing about backups is the “health” of those backups. Specifically – a) how close in time can we get a backup to a disaster, and b) if we restore from those backups, do they actually work. There is a corollary point about risk management – or how easy is to actually damage data so that restoring from a backup is required, but we’ll touch on that issue several times as we go on.

One error that I find SMEs make is by using Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, or Google Drive as backup solutions. These are not backup solutions – putting data in the cloud is not the same as “backing up”. But, that issue is out of scope for today – we’ll get to it tomorrow. However, an even bigger error is not to backup at all. Having a backup strategy, and having a strategy for monitoring the health of the backups, is very likely the single most important IT issue that has to be managed within an SME.  

Wherever possible, we should try to automate IT functions within the business – after all, we’re talking about computers, and they are custom designed to do the same boring process again and again without error. Backup health is one issue that doesn’t . Fundamentally, if you want to confirm the health of a backup, someone has to go and find the backup and try to restore it.

A good way to do this is to have a junior member of staff who is tasked with this job, and make sure it’s diarised in their calendar. However, if you do this, it’s important to make sure that someone senior within the business periodically checks the checks as it were.

We’re going to talk more about backups as we go on, as this is a big thought, but for now, this is the key point – your backups have to be stellar, and you have to have some process in place to check their health.

Take care,
Matt
