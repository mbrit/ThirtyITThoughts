# Thought #11: Disposable machines
[Home](/)

Hi,

Now that we've got to thought 11 of "30 IT Thoughts", it's time to think about what happens when things go wrong.

Way back at the start, we spoke about how a key reason why businesses buy IT is to control risk. As we've also said, IT is technology that is designed to manipulate information as its raw material. Like any activity that includes refining and processing of raw material, we can loosely categorise the notion of "non-disaster" as being defined as cases that "if we put data somewhere, it stays where it is", as opposed to the notion of "disaster" as being defined as cases that "if we put data somewhere, it ends up somewhere we don't want it". 

For example, in one disaster scenario we might put information on a computer's disk, but we can't access the data because the computer caught fire and melted around it. In another disaster scenario, we might have customer information on a laptop, which we then leave in the back of a taxi and now we don't know where that information is. We're going to look at the former idea first, and the latter idea in the next thought.

We've gone through at length core issues related to backups – and certainly the solution to "my computer caught fire" is "restore from a backup". We're not going rehash issues about backups here, but instead we should focus on just how "disposable" our devices are. In short, our devices – laptops, phones, desktops, etc – should be as disposable as they possibly can be. There should be nothing "special" about any piece of IT hardware you own – we should aim to make it such that it can be replaced within hours. This is a core tenant of disaster recovery and disaster planning within IT.

Computer systems – including smartphones – have three parts: hardware, software, and data. Hardware can be replaced with fresh capital expenditure. Data can be replaced with backups. Where a lot of SME owners get tripped up when a disaster does occur is the *software* aspect.

Nowadays, we tend to use a lot of cloud software, but oftentimes we find that we have "on-premises" software as well – this is what we now tend to call software that is actually installed, as opposed to accessed over the internet. It's not uncommon to find that SMEs retain accounting systems like Sage or QuickBooks as installed, on-premises software. 

For the cloud software, it's again not uncommon to find that no one knows the usernames and passwords to access these systems, or even that the page that you need to access isn't known but is stored in the user's web browser bookmarks. It's therefore sensible to make sure that you maintain a list of the cloud services, their URLs, together with the usernames and passwords somewhere safe so that they can be referred to in a disaster.

This itself can get somewhat "turtles all the way down", as if you are electronically storing your list of cloud services in a cloud service, how do you know that you can access that list in a disaster? This is why one of my core recommendations it that the most important access details are physically printed out and stored in a fireproof safe or a deed box at a director's house. If it really does all go to custard, all you have to do is find those printouts and hopefully it is not a big job to start unpicking things from there.

In terms of the on-premises software, it's important to maintain a list of what is installed and where, along with any disks or other media that are used for installation, together with any license details or product keys. I've seen too often people just be unable to find software that their business is entirely dependent on in an emergency.

The point of planning is that you are able to recover from a disaster quickly. By putting these steps in place today, you should be able to find that if everything does go wrong, a quick trip to Currys PC World (or next day from Amazon), a quick restore from a cloud backup (the details for which are all in your fireproof safe), and a quick reinstallation of your accounts system (the disk for which is also in your fireproof safe), and you're up and running by the evening, as opposed to fighting the problem for days.

Take care,
Matt
