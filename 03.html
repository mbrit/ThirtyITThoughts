# Thought 3: Data-driven business
[Home](/)

Hi,

So, onto the third of "30 IT Thoughts in 30 Days".

There's a scene in The IT Crowd where Jen – the IT manager – is asked "what does IT stand for?" The joke being that Jen doesn't know what it stands for despite her running the IT department – but the question puts into focus something of a lie in the industry. Information Technology is a set of technologies that deal with *data*, not with *information*. It should be called "Data Technology".

The difference – as I was told when I did GCSE computer science more years ago than I care to remember is that information and data are related in that data is the result of what happens when you take information and apply structure. Someone who runs a café intuitively knows that it gets busy at lunchtime – this is information – but if you specifically measure how many customers are served at lunchtime compared to the rest of the data, that information through application of structure becomes data. At its purest, data is information that has been tabulated and can be analysed.

Despite the fact that virtually all businesses use IT, very few businesses use data, and when we're looking at innovation and capability building and being able to do things our peers cannot, making our businesses "data-driven" is the key to the game. The principle of "data-driven" is when we aspire to collect as much data as possible, *and* a) develop a preference for making decisions based on data, and b) continuously improve our ability to do so.

Within SMEs particularly, we tend to keep great gobs of unstructured information and call it data. Mailboxes are full of emails, which we have to search through. File servers are full of files that sit there for years and years, albeit with some kind of grouping or categorisation. It is information not data because decisions cannot be made based on it without it refined into data. 

All businesses experiences constant flows of information, because every event within the business creates information. This can be something as concrete as a customer phoning in with a customer service query, to something as ephemeral as how much coffee a team gets through each week. There is a principle in police forensics investigations that every time a person interacts with a space, some forensic evidence persists that can be detected and acted upon – that is exactly the same as what is happening here. Every action within a business creates information, but that information is a raw material that is of no use until it is refined into data.

When we have data, we can make decisions, because data allows us to look for patterns, and act accordingly. 

As we go on, we'll look at concrete examples of this process in action.

Take care,
Matt
