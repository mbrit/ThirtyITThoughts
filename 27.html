# Thought #27: Passwords
[Home](/)

Hi,

In thought 27 we’re going to look at a misunderstood aspect of passwords and passwords management. 

tl;dr – you need to make sure that you are using unique, strong passwords for each and every site or app that you use, and you need to use a password manager to keep track of them all.

And here’s why…

Your online identity is the sum of the services that you use. If you found yourself the position of having a complete list of all of my usernames and passwords for every service that I use, you could effectively be me. You’d have access to my bank accounts, be able to go into Companies House and remove me as a director of my own businesses, cancel my car insurance, watch my Netflix, order anything you wanted on Amazon, etc. Because we do so much online these days, there is pretty much nothing that I could do that you could not.

The more complicated that list of passwords is – i.e. the more entries on it – the harder you will find it to “be me”. If I use the same password anywhere, all you have to do is snaffle that one password and you have the crown jewels – you have access to the lot. If I use 200 different services and there are 200 unique passwords on it, what I am doing is creating “bulkheads” between each different service. You may snaffle my Netflix password, and you can pretend to be me and watch Red Dwarf for the thousandth time, but you can’t get into my online banking.

Passwords have to be two things – they have to be strong, and they have to be unique. The reason why they have to be unique I’ve covered above, but the mechanics of it are worth going over. Large sites and/or competent, like Amazon, Facebook, or Lloyds Bank don’t get hacked and they don’t lose passwords. When you register an account with them, they will keep and store your password in a way that is (to all intents and purposes) impervious to attack. However, if you use the same password as your Amazon account with a little tin-pot ecommerce site for a shop in your local town, and they do not have the same ability to secure it, if someone breaks into that ecommerce site and steals that password, hackers will use software to use try that password against hundreds of thousands of sites. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link – and it’s easier to not trust every site (no matter how unlikely their chance of leaking a password – than it is to make a qualitative assessment on a case-by-case basis.

Hackers like to build tools that let them do work automatically. This is a basic tenet of software engineering – build a tool to do something rather than do all the hard work manually. (We spoke about this when we looked at software robots.)

With that in mind, imagine a hacker hacks into a web site and accesses to the database of usernames and passwords for that site. With direct access to the database, they can brute force the passwords – i.e. try every single possible guess for your password. If your password is eight characters long and contains only letters and digits, e.g. “p4ssw0rd”, it’ll take three days to guess it. If you use a genuinely strong password, which is a mix of upper-case, lower-case, and special characters, such as “iwSX&Plu”, it’ll take 28,000 *years* to guess the password. Again, you’re looking at the weakest link, so the principle here would be get the password database from a poorly secured web site, work out the password, and then try it on your online banking, social media, etc.

Creating a genuinely strong random password can be done using a dedicated site, such as <https://strongpasswordgenerator.com/>. However, a better approach is to use a password manager, such as 1Password, LastPass, or Dashlane. These works by creating a secure store of passwords in the cloud where all your devices are able to share a set of passwords. (Your mileage may very on the cost of the products and capabilities, but LastPass has a free tier that works across devices.) You can also use it on your phone to log into apps.

It took me years to get used to using a password manager, however I can’t imagine not using one now. Even if you try to use it and struggle to get on with it, it is worth persevering. If you don’t use one already, download it and try using it for a couple of weeks.

Within our businesses, good password hygiene needs to be practiced. (What’s the point of us being super-secure with our passwords and then having our social media manager set our Twitter password to “p4ssw0rd”?) You can create a policy that password managers should be used, and passwords not shared. Like all cybersecurity issues, “winning” in this looks mostly like cultural change – the tools aren’t difficult or expensive, you just have to get buy in.

Take care,
Matt
