# Thought #16: Email (The Basics)
[Home](/)

Hi,

Welcome to thought 16 of “30 IT Thoughts”. Today, we’re going to think about email.

Email is probably the most important, most business-critical system that you operate, yet it’s the one that we tend to think about least. It’s a technology that is so basic that it falls into the category of “ticket to entry” – i.e. it’s something that you have to have in place in order to trade. Most people (customers, suppliers, partners) will expect to be able to communicate effectively with a business via email – it’s likely that you have this expectation, but that it’s so embedded we generally don’t think about it. 

There are a few edges of email systems that we need to think about: availability, performance, and discovery.

In terms of availability, the most common accepted solution to this is to run our email systems in the cloud. Go back far enough and we used to run our own email servers on our own computers in our own offices (“on-premises”), but a combination of a) it’s critical nature and b) it’s dirt cheap pricing means that email is now virtually always a cloud service that we rent on a monthly basis. 

A wrinkle here is that there are really only two email services worth buying – Exchange as part of Microsoft 365 (née Office 365), and Gmail as part of G Suite. A lot of SMEs can fall into the trap of using an email service provided by their web hosting provider. This is part historical, and part how hosting companies sell their services. The link between your website and your email service is tenuous at best – they’re completely different things, yet because historically we bought both services from the same person, we tend to tie the two concepts together.

Performance-wise, whilst the physical sending and receiving of email is simple enough, we have to think about what we do with the “raw material” of these emails as they leave and come into the business. It’s no good to receive an enquiry from a new customer to find that email go either into a) our spam folders, or b) go into someone’s inbox and then get lost. Emails have to be “massaged” into some workflow within the business so that effective action is reliably taken. For additional sophistication, we can look at how we can adjust resourcing within the business so that emails are dealt with in the event of staff sickness, holidays, etc – i.e. that we’re not just binding emails to one specific member of staff.

This usually means having emails worked into a CRM system of some description. In that way, we can capture internal workflows associated with “a quote/proposal needs to nursed from enquiry to pitch/sale”, or “a customer complain needs to be managed to some satisfactory conclusion”. Similarly, external workflows need to be managed too – and going back to a previous thought, this is where a CRM can be invaluable within the business in creating a “single pane of glass” so that all of these workflows can be visualised, assessed, and optimised.

Because it is a written form of communication, there are risks related to email. In effect, email becomes the de facto source of exactly what your business has promised to do – or rather, what anyone in your business has promised that they will do or won’t do. Lawyers have this notion of “e-discovery”, which is the process of finding all the digital artefacts that you have floating around in the business that might have some basis in litigation, arbitration, or some other dispute. 

This means at a minimum you need to keep backups of your email, because there may be something that you need to rely on that you need to have. This is why backing up your email using a cloud-to-cloud backup service is so important. We mentioned this technology briefly in thought 9 – what it does is take a copy of your whole Microsoft 365 or G Suite data and backs it up so that you can restore it later. This is very helpful if you lose emails that you need to rely on. Because Microsoft and Google are never just going to up and lose your data, the “vector” your defending against is either someone making a mistake and deleting emails, or a bad actor deleting emails deliberately. We’re going to talk more about that in the next thought.

Take care,
Matt
