# Thought #17: Email's intrinsic value
[Home](/)

Hi,

In though 17 of "30 IT Thoughts", we're going to look more into email.

In the last thought, we looked at how email was this kind of universal communication channel into our business that everyone expects to be able to use to communicate with your business. 

The opportunity with email is that most people look at it as just a massive blob of text that simply sits there in mailboxes within the business – very few people try to extract value from all that communication. Consider for a moment that if email is the most commonly use communication channel into and out of your business, it follows that what you have if you look at all of those emails in aggregate is actually a tremendous store of value – after all, it contains mostly everything you've ever said, and everything someone has ever said to you.

(Of course there will be in-person and over-the-phone voice communication, but the information within it is ephemeral. Email has the twin advantages of a) there's a lot of it, and b) it's permanent/semi-permanent.)

Some people diligently file every email they ever receive, and some people just let their emails build up in their inbox. I'll put my hand up here and say that I'm firmly in the latter, and simply assume that if I need to find something I'll just search for it. However, within a team there is a great deal of value to be had from filing emails in project folders that can be accessed by anyone in that team. This process – email filing – can be done direct from Outlook and into folders within Exchange (or labels with Gmail), but you can get much more value from using SharePoint. 

It's not really my intent within this programme to talk about products specifically, but Microsoft 365 is such a universal package that every business should use, and it comes with SharePoint as part of their business plans, that it's fairly safe for me to suggest it here. An excellent model to use with SharePoint is to set-up sites for each project (if you're project-based) or customer (if you're not project based), and file inbound and outbound emails within each site. (You can set this up to work automatically or semi-automatically, if you're feeling fancy.) The value here is that once you also start filing all artefacts (documents) related to a project also in those same sites, then SharePoint becomes a central, cloud-based and cloud-accessible store of all information pertaining to a project. You can then search across either projects or across the whole business, turning up emails as part of the search results. This massively unlocks the value of the text contained within the emails.

If you happen to prefer G Suite to Microsoft 365, you can do the same thing with Google Drive, but it's not *quite* as powerful. The ultimate advantage with SharePoint is that if you also do your CRM really well, and manage to get it to act like a "single pane of glass" as we've previously spoken about, you can bring SharePoint and the CRM together, mixing the value of both to create something really special. 

Email archiving is something else that we need to think about, but fair warning this an approach I have been using in my own business for nearly 20 years, but I hugely struggle to sell. The principle of email archiving is that you take every email that comes into the business or leaves the business and stores it in a secure database that only the directors of the business can access. It is a one-way, immutable, secure vault that you as a business owner can rely on if things go to custard, for example if you get into a legal dispute with a customer, or an HR issue within the business.

As mentioned previously the problem with emails is that mailboxes can be changed. Emails can be deleted, and even modified, when they are "at rest" within someone's mailbox. For example, if you suspect that one employee has been bullying another and using email to do it, there's nothing to stop them from deleting those emails from their mailboxes. Having a separate email archive that can only be accessed by the directors puts you in a much stronger position should some form of dispute ensue. I've relied on an email archives on at least two occasions in my career, and it's paid dividends each time.

Take care,
Matt
