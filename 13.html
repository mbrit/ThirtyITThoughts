# Thought #13: Flow
[Home](/)

Hi,

In today’s “IT Thought” – number 13 – we’re going to look at “flow”.

Flow isn’t an IT concept – it’s a psychology concept. It’s the state at which, when undertaking an activity, we reach a level of performance where we become so immersed in and focused on a task that we achieve almost supernatural levels of productivity.

If we’re lucky, we get to achieve flow in our professional lives, and there are moments at work where we get so absorbed in what we do that we lose track of time – looking at the results at the end and finding we’ve done something really decent. If we’re very lucky, we get to employ people who also achieve flow in their professional lives and also get to enjoy that sort of “flow-based” output within the business. 

However, IT can really get in the way of flow, whether that’s affecting us or someone who works for us. How we set-up and manage out IT can stop flow from getting started, or it can cause one’s state of flow to break off midstream. Flow is tricky to achieve, and some studies say it needs 30 minutes or so to achieve flow (a number I feel personally is roughly right), so from a straightforward efficiency perspective, things that you can do to preserve flow are likely to see some benefit.

IT can get in the way of flow either because a) it’s flaky and causes interruption and frustration, or b) because it’s not set-up in an optimal way to support flow. We’re going to look at the second part here, because the first part – flakiness – we’ve covered in part previously and we’ll touch on again as we go on.

Car manufacturers put a lot of work into designing cars so that they help the driver achieve flow. Driving is something that, once learnt, is done entirely in an “unconscious competence” state – i.e. you just do it, and you don’t know you’re doing it. When people design their IT set-up in the offices, they don’t think about flow in the same way that car manufactures do. We can “box clever” about how we do things and how we set things up to both promote flow, and limit the chances or interrupting flow.

If you trace back the history of computers, they were all designed on the principle that you take a desk and put a keyboard and a screen on it. Eventually they were joined by the mouse as an input device. This is the basic configuration that you need to achieve flow, but thanks to the prevalence of laptop computers, a lot of people miss this. Putting a laptop on a desk and hunching over a small monitor and a keyboard, and using a trackpad instead of a mouse, actively militates against flow. It is much better, if your “daily driver” (the computer that you use every day) is a laptop that when working with it you plug it into a monitor, a full-sized keyboard, and a mouse, as if it were a normal desktop machine.

What’s better than using a single monitor is using two monitors. In the before times, a) we used to work more with paper than we do now, and b) monitors are much cheaper than they used to. As such, it is much easier for people to work with a second screen that they can show reference material on (an email, a PDF, a website, etc), and use the main monitor for production. If you do have a laptop, you can use the laptop’s screen as a second screen, using a riser like a “Kensington Easy Riser” than you can find on Amazon.

When working from home, the temptation is that we have a full-sized desktop set-up at work, and go back to hunching over a small screen when we are at home. It’s well worth the investment in duplicating as near as possible the set-up that we have at work. After all, the trend of working from home is only doing to see a higher level of adoption.

Finally, where you can don’t be tempted to do work on a smartphone. Smartphones are in no way designed to achieve flow (no for “knowledge worker”-type work in any case) – it’s usually better to put the smartphone down and find your PC.

Take care,
Matt
