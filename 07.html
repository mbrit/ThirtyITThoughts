# Thought #7: CRM
[Home](/)

Hi,

As we move into thought 7 of "30 IT Thoughts", we can start to look more at the nuts and bolts of IT, and we'll start with CRM.

CRM – customer relationship management systems – is an absolutely essential piece of software for a business to have, but many SME owners put off implementation of a CRM system because exactly what it is and why the business should have one can be a little opaque.

The purpose of a CRM is to provide a single place where a record of kept of any and every customer's relationship with you from cradle to grave. Ultimately, it creates a single, definitive point where anyone in the business can both look to see the micro integrations with a customer, and the macro effects of all customers within the business on aggregate. One way to look at it is that a CRM is a "single pane of glass" through which you can peer and see every single detail about every single customer.

The trick with CRM is that it's very easy to fail and get no more value from it then you would had you just found a shoebox somewhere and started to keep business cards in it. It's at this point that most people come unstuck.

The reason why a shoebox full of business cards is not equivalent to a CRM is that a shoebox full of business cards records basic biographical data, and does not describe anything about the *story* of that customer and who they are to you. CRM starts by capturing data on introduction – usually if the customer is at prospect stage, through qualification to appointment, through sales and close, then through to onboarding into the business, through all the operational things that happen whilst they're your customer and you're happily invoicing them, through to the point at which they stop being a customer. 

CRM often finds its way into the business because one section of the business needs it and uses it – a common method of introduction of a CRM into a business is through the sales team who will lobby the business for a CRM in order to track their sales pipeline. The danger here is that the CRM system, which should be without doubt a company-wide proposition, get stuck in that one sales function.

We spoke before about how every action within a business creates data, and that data should be recorded somewhere. This is where the CRM comes in, because that should be the central repository for everything to do with the data. As I said above, the "micro" details here are important for the actual day-to-day work with a customer – for example, a customer who phones up with a query will find anyone in the business can service that query because all the data needed to service the query is in the CRM.

It's problematic – and this aspect is tricky – to try and balance out the need that every piece of data related to a customer should be recorded in the CRM. (I'm going to assume you have your obligations under privacy regulations covered off here.) In theory, every email, phone call, meeting, thought, anything related to that customer should be recorded into the CRM, and that implies a lot of manual work. However, we should now be starting to see some of this picture come together – if were being data driven and we're innovating well enough, that data should automatically find its way into the CRM.

For example, we might do an email marketing campaign and record the "sends" on that campaign in the CRM automatically. We might then track the clicks on the email, again sending that back into the CRM automatically. When a customer sees the website, has a query and phones in – the fact a phone call was received should go into the CRM automatically too. You see where I'm going with this – all of these pieces of data can be automatically brought out of all of these systems and aggregated into the CRM as part of the narrative describing the customer's life with us.

When we have this level of detail and this pane of glass that lets us see details, we can look at the "macro" side too, using this data to determine trends. "Just how many customers do phone with a query when we do an email campaign? Is there something we need to do about that – is it good they phone and we have a chance to close, or does it mean they're getting frustrated?" It's this bit – this data-driven bit – that's exciting.

Take care,
Matt
