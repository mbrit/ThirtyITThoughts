# Thought #15: Can IT help You pivot?
[Home](/)

Hi – and welcome to thought 15 of “30 IT Thoughts”. At this point we’re halfway through, and we’re going to briefly have another look at this “innovation” point that we touched on back at the beginning.

Can IT help you “pivot” your business? Well, tldr, yes – because as we mentioned way back at the beginning IT is simply a toolkit for innovation. 

I’m writing this in the middle of a worldwide crisis, and we’re all facing similar challenges in that not only is everything being disrupted, but we don’t have a firm idea on what the world will look like once things settle down. There are some industries that are doing very well – holding stock in Amazon, Zoom Video Communications Inc, and a handful of others would seem to offer some benefits – but some industries are doing very badly. Regardless, most of us are experiencing an existential crisis right now, and the word “pivot” is writ large.

This current crisis is having an effect everywhere, and that is unusual – but having your industry disrupted is *not* unusual. It’s an “evergeen” threat – we all run the risk of waking up and finding that someone else is eating our lunch. It’s a trite example, but if you were to travel back in time far enough, you could make a good living [knocking on people’s windows waking them up to go to work](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35840393).

This reminds me of a famous memo (in IT circles anyway) that Bill Gates sent to all Microsoft staff in 1995 about how the company needed to adjust it’s how outlook to meet [the internet tidal wave](https://www.fastcompany.com/4039009/22-years-ago-today-bill-gates-wrote-his-legendary-internet-tidal-wave-memo). (The history here is that Microsoft thought the internet was a flash in the pan and were not aggressively developing products that worked in a world where the internet was everywhere.) Microsoft is and was at that time an enormous business, and their “pivot” (sudden change of direction) was like turning a supertanker. As smaller businesses, we’re expected to be able to pivot all the time. 

One of the weirdest things about not just the UK governments handling but their counterparts around the world is that they made certain businesses illegal. Usually if your business is about to be made illegal, you can see the writing on the wall for years, but companies like pubs, cinemas, event spaces – anywhere that required people to gather got told that they were no longer allowed to trade if not overnight, then with a few weeks notice. The reaction for a lot of businesses was, “OK, we’ll just take the business online.” A common method for doing this is, of course, video conferencing.

Video conferencing and even telepresence technologies are not new, and that means that they are a) cheap, and b) because they are cheap, it cannot be an innovative technology in and of itself because their cheap price tells you there is plentiful supply and matched demand. 

In particular, I love networking and networking groups, but virtually every networking group online announced pretty much the day after the lockdown announcements that they were “going virtual”.

With respect, this is not innovation, because innovation needs to be something that no one else is doing. Microsoft were not being innovative either by changing position from “the internet isn’t a thing” to “oh, wait, the internet is a thing” – they were on the wrong trajectory and adjusted course. How they *did it* would likely have involved innovation, because they likely did a bunch of unique things. 

Whilst I’d be the first to say that quoting Wikipedia in an article is lazy writing, I didn’t know the difference between fish “shoaling” and fish “schooling” when I sat down to write this. Shoaling is for fish that group together for social reasons, and whenever we see fish moving in the same direction, this process is “schooling” ([citation given](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling)). Schooling behaviour helps fish in many ways, including staving off predators, because (most) fish are prey animals. 

When there is a crisis within a business community, it follows we’ll likely see the same “schooling” behaviour – e.g. when we see all networking groups “pivot” from in-person to online events, we’re not seeing “pivoting”, we’re seeing “schooling” because a bunch of similar organisations are clumping together and all moving in a new direction *together*, and at the same time. There cannot be innovation here, because as they are all doing the same thing, we’re not seeing any differentiation, and finding new ways to differentiate is what innovation *is*. 

That then seems like the challenge, that when we see an existential crisis that is either affecting just our industry, or our industry along with any others, what can we do that’s different? We’re not fish – businesses are not prey animals that thrive when being undifferentiated. We need difference in order to outcompete the other businesses looking for market share. In this time of enormous change, are you *genuinely* pivoting, or are you “schooling”?

Take care,
Matt
