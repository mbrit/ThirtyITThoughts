# Thought #12: Non-disposable Data
[Home](/)

Hi,

In thought 12 of “30 IT Thoughts”, we’re going to have a look at the risk of losing data through data leaks. 

When we’ve looked at “loss” before when it comes to data, we’ve really only been considering having data put beyond our use, and hence beyond our benefit – for example, a computer holding our data might catch fire, the disk melts, and we can’t access that data. Or, someone in our team deletes some data by accident. If we lose data in this way, we become unable to do whatever job depended on that data, and the biggest loser in that situation is us. For example, if we lose the details of the invoices that we have issued, we might not be able to chase payment. If we lose details of a project that we are working on, we might be late on delivery, find ourselves in breach, and end up in court.

Some types of data that we hold within our business is of a different type – it’s the type of data that we do not *own*, but store and use but is bound up in some sort of trust relationship. There are legal obligations with regards to personal data (specifically, GDPR-type stuff), but there are ethical obligations regarding all types of data, personal or not. Customers only give us data in order to facilitate some job that we are doing for them as part of our contract with them – that tells us that data must have some value, and where there is value there must be risk of loss that our customers will be exposed to in the result of a loss, even if we are not. Ipso facto, if we lose that data, someone’s going to get annoyed at us.

In short, if you have data, it’s generally better for the health of your business to make sure that you look after it. This means that your systems need to be secure (a topic we’ll touch on a few times as we go on), that you engage with employees or partners who are trustworthy, and that you actively manage some of the more likely “risk vectors” associated with data leaks.

(It’s not my intent in this programme to get into GDPR stuff, or the fallout that can happen if you happen to lose personal data. Suffice to say, the legislation is written to strongly concentrate the mind on *not* losing personal data.)

If we step over “secure systems” for now (as I said, we’ll get to that), we find ourselves back at the two main ways in which mistakes can happen – acts of stupidity, or acts of malice. As I’ve said before, computer systems do not lose or corrupt information – it’s things happening in the wider universe that cause data loss or corruption. A key way in which things can go to custard in this regard is simply having someone do something stupid by accident (imagine an employee ham-fisted enough to email a list of your customers to a competitor), or something malicious for any one of a million reasons. The weak link in any computer system is always a human being. Imagine an employee annoyed enough at you to leak some data, or an employee at one of your suppliers who has a secret they need to keep and finds themselves blackmailed into stealing your data. 

There isn’t much you can do about this – especially as a smaller business. There are technical solutions that come under the umbrella of “boundary protection” that makes it harder to move data from within the business to outside the business. (i.e. it stops data crossing a boundary, hence the name.) This sort of solution can stop an employee accidentally or “accidentally” emailing a list of your customers out of the business, but these solutions are expensive, and are suited to large corporates, not SMEs. A better solution is to try and focus on empowerment and trust – i.e. hiring the right people, engaging with the right suppliers with the right sort of culture and protection in place, as well as training and educating so that people understand the damage that they can do should they fall asleep at the wheel.

Take care,
Matt
