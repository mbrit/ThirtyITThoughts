# Thought #19: Why do people sell IT?
[Home](/)

Hi,

As we enter the home straight of "30 IT Thoughts" with thought 19, we're going to look at the corollary of the first thought – "Why do we buy IT?" – with the question: "Why do people sell IT?"

As business owners, we're often reminded to wear our salesperson hat and to make sure that we fully understand our customer. We're expected to know our "customer persona" inside out and upside down, and be able to shape our marketing strategy and sales process to maximise the access to our market and our potential customers. What we're almost never asked to do is to ruminate on the other side of the sales process – i.e. when we're in the market to buy, we're not encouraged to look at the seller's motivation. 

Sales is an odd process because it is something we all have to engage in, but it is adversarial in nature. If you're buying something, you expect the salesperson to hold some cards close to their chest. The salesperson wants to maximise their profit (and possibly obfuscate certain aspects of the proposition that are unattractive), and the buyer wants to minimise spend and maximise value. This is business – it's not charity – and it's a game we all play.

The very peculiar thing about IT sales is that if you look at a spectrum of businesses from very small to very large, at the very large end *every* business has an IT support function of some sort. Their IT is actively managed either with an in-house team, or by an outsourced team. There must be some exceptions to this rule, but I am yet to even hear of any business of any decent size not have an IT function, let alone see one. 

At the other end, very small businesses usually start without an IT function. Therefore, as a business grows, it logically follows that there a) must be something that happens as a function of business growth that transforms a business from "non-customer of IT services" to "customer of IT services", b) that state of being an customer of IT services becomes permanent, and c) because of the universality of that transition, there must be some common "pain point" that turns a business from having a zero IT spend per annum to a *significant" IT spend per annum. Eventually, every business will have some not-ignorable percentage of the costs attributable to IT.

This fact appears to be a secret within the IT industry – not even people within the IT industry appear to be clued in to this. Managed IT support businesses, sell on locality (business owners like their IT support to be local, typically), but do not sell on any particular sales pain point – yet there must be a *common* pain point because of this universal transition related to growth that causes business to start permanently buying IT services. If you look at any marketing from an IT support businesses, they talk about "local, proactive support" and typically link it to ideas of partnership, but none of them explain *why*. 

This, to me, running an IT support business has been one of the most peculiar realisations in the development of my business. That you have a market that sells essentially the same product to everyone without any single vendor needing to sit down and position against solving a particular pain point. All that happens is we all create this virtual shop with a sign over the door that says "IT support services", and eventually a growing local business will walk in and say "I want some IT support services, please", and commerce ensues.

What tends to be the reason why people buy IT support services is that there is some "straw breaks the camel's back" event where the owner or other senior staff member cannot deal with managing their own IT anymore. At the start, a lot of small businesses will start up buy buying laptops from Currys PC World, getting Microsoft 365, some broadband, and off they go. As there are needs within the business, they are satisfied by someone who knows enough about computers and/or the problem-of-the-day to break off from what they're doing and fix it. Eventually, something happens and they will go, "you know what, I've had enough of this, I'm going to get someone else to do it", hence they walk through the door of the virtual shop and from that point on, they are permanently customers to a succession of IT support businesses.

Where this comes back to you as a customer of these services (and you either are one or will become one) is that it's worth being attuned to the fact that your supplier is "institutionally" not attuned to thinking about why you are buying and why they are selling. It is worth when engaging in these sorts of interactions to really focus on that *why*, and to do some from both sides of table.

Take care,
Matt
